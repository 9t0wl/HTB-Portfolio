      <h2>‚ú® Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This write-up walks through the EscapeTwo machine from Hack The Box. As
        a Windows-based machine rated "Easy," it offers an engaging dive into
        Active Directory enumeration, DACL manipulation, and certificate-based
        privilege escalation.

      <h2>üîé Reconnaissance</h2>
      <p>We begin with an Nmap scan to identify open ports and services:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>nmap -sC -sV -Pn -p- 10.10.11.XXX</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Open ports included typical AD services such as SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos.
        From there, we began enumerating for usernames and shares.

      <h2>üîê Initial Access</h2>
      <p>
        We obtained initial credentials or enumerated shares and usernames via
        SMB or LDAP. Using these, we authenticated and began exploring AD.
      </p>
      <p>
        After pivoting through enumeration, we identified a low-privileged user:
        <code>rose / KxEPkKe6R8su</code>

      <h2>ü™® Privilege Escalation</h2>
      <p>
        Running BloodHound revealed that the user had privileges to modify
        DACLs. We used <code>bloodyAD</code> or <code>dacledit.py</code> to
        assign rights to another account.
      </p>
      {/* <InjectedImage imgSrc={BloodHound} alt="BloodHound Output" /> */}
      <p>
        With DACLs modified, we leveraged <code>certipy-ad</code> to request a
        certificate and impersonate the privileged account.
      </p>
      {/* <InjectedImage imgSrc={Certipy} alt="certipy-ad usage" /> */}

      <h2>üìÇ Flags Captured</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>user.txt:</strong> Acquired after gaining initial access with
          low-privilege credentials.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>root.txt:</strong> Captured after escalating using certificate
          abuse via Certipy.

      <h2>üìö Lessons Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows enumeration with SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos</li>
        <li>DACL manipulation and privilege assignment</li>
        <li>Using BloodHound for privilege mapping</li>
        <li>Abusing AD CS with Certipy for full compromise</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Great learning opportunity to reinforce Active Directory privilege
        escalation techniques!
