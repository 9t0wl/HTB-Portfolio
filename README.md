# 🔐 HTB Portfolio - Hack The Box Machine Writeups

Welcome to my personal portfolio of Hack The Box (HTB) machine writeups, built using **React** + **custom design**.

This project showcases my ethical hacking and penetration testing journey by documenting how I solved a variety of HTB machines.  
Each writeup includes:

- Methodology
- Screenshots
- Tools and techniques used
- Lessons learned

Live site (if hosted): [COMING SOON]

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React.js (Vite / CRA)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 / CSS3
- Custom components + reusable layouts
